# StazinskiProject1
Sorry this is late, here is my project 1 (as far as I could get) I had a mix up with my job and missed this deadline, it will not happen again.

# Simple Calculator

The goal was to implement a simple calculator to show the basics of xml and kotlin

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User sees the grid of numbers, and functions, and the larger text window at the top
* [x] User can click on any number, ., C, %, and +/- and get the expected result
* [x] Top textview has textAlignment set to “textEnd”, textSize as 80sp, and textStyle is “bold”
* [x] The “0” button occupies twice the space as other buttons (in terms of width).
* [x] Every component has a margin of 2dp and a text size of 30 sp (except the top textView).
The following **extensions** are implemented:

* A style for the buttons in the grid, making updating the application in the future much easier
* Chaning the color of the buttons to green.

## Video Walkthrough

I was not able to get this done in time

## Notes

I had a mix up with the deadline and work, I will do my best to avoid this in the future.
I am very sorry that this is late, but I do feel I learnt a lot through this project, despite its tardyness
